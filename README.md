## Problem Statement

### Understanding Noisy Data Responses
Processing responses containing noisy data into interpretable data, such as average values and their uncertainties, is crucial for researchers. It enables them to understand the accuracy of measurements, the amount of data required, its relevance to future experiments, and any critical considerations in sampling.

### Factors in Post-Processing
Post-processing involves considering averages, uncertainties, and various factors like experimental characteristics, material properties, data processing methods, and fitting noisy data sets. Fitting polynomial plots with irregular or non-homogeneous stimulus spacings is particularly important in data analysis.

### Deriving Accurate Calculations
This project focuses on simple mathematical calculations to understand the energetics of polymer materials and their thermodynamic properties. Thermodynamics concerns the heat possessed by a system, reflecting its internal energy. By calculating heat energy changes with temperature variations, phase transitions and material thermal properties can be understood. However, it's essential to note that different differentiation methods may yield different uncertainties. Therefore, the goal is to derive accurate calculated values considering these factors in post-processing.
