Package
==========

This is a single package to process the MD data.
In physical experiments or numerical analyses, dealing with noisy data is inevitable. This data typically represents numerical values of responses induced by external stimuli, fluctuating randomly over time. For instance, chemical species exhibit changes in their structure, properties, and thermodynamic properties even with small temperature variations, and this happens in magnetic materials' magnetization.
